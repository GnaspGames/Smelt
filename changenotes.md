Smelt Change Notes
==================

Version 0.8.0
-------------

* Introducing Variables!
    * Documentation doesn't exist yet. See example below.
* Multiline commands supported. 
    * **BREAKING CHANGE**: Backslash (`\`) feature removed.
    * **BREAKING CHANGE**: Now JSON blocks need a `>` character preceding them. 
      You MCC code will need to be updated.
    * JSON, Minecraft commands, and Bang commands can now span multiple lines.
        * Any new line starting with a trigger character (`#`,`>`,`/`,`!`,`$`) 
          will finalise the previous line.
* C-style and C++-style commenting now supported. See example below.

Example:

    // Declare variables - single line comment
    $Name=Johann
    $NameAndTitle=Mr $Name
    $Message=Hello $Name

    #Start
    >{"type":"impulse",
      "auto":true}
    /say $Name
        >{"type":"chain"}
        /say $Message
        /*
            Example of a multiline comment
        */ 
        $Message=Goodbye $NameAndTitle
        /say $Message // The message has changed!

Output:

    [@] Johann
    [@] Hello Johann
    [@] Goodbye Mr Johann


Many thanks to [Johann/Skaran](https://twitter.com/SkaranYT) for is contributions towards these features!

Version 0.7.5
-------------

* Fixed a line endings bug issue that stopped Smelt working on Linux OS.

Version 0.7.4
-------------

* Added a version check to encourage you to update if your version of Smelt is out of date.

Version 0.7.3
-------------

* Updated some of the help output. `smelt help`, `smelt help compile` etc.
    * More details found in the [CLI documentation](http://smelt.gnasp.com/cli.html)

Version 0.7.2
-------------

* Improved the use of `smelt config --change-local` and `smelt config --change-global` to be faster to use.
    * Includes adding a description and validation for each setting.
* Changed the name of the configuration setting `SummonLineMarkers` to `SummonRowMarkers` because the term 'row' is what's been used elsewhere.
    * NOTE: This might require some users to run `smelt config --change-local` or `smelt config --change-global` again to correct their own config files.
